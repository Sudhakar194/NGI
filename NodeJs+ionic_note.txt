-Base64 is a binary to text encoding scheme that is generally used to transfer content-based messages over the Internet. It works by dividing every three bits of binary data into six bit units.

A Binary Large OBject (BLOB) is a collection of binary data stored as a single entity in a database management system. Blobs are typically images, audio or other multimedia objects, though sometimes binary executable code is stored as a blob. Database support for blobs is not universal.

Cordova is a framework that gives you Javascript bindings to invoke native functionality on a mobile device. Each functionality is accessed using a plugin system and so for a typical project there would be multiple plugins. These can be installed using CLI. Ionic provides a JS, HTML and CSS components beautifully designed for the web and leverages Cordova's awesome plugins for accessing device functionalities. Thus without Cordova, you cannot access any device specific features in Ionic.

ionic = cordova + angular

----- errors ----------------------------------
1) [ERROR] An error occurred while running subprocess cordova.
Ans: clear all jdk which is installed version 8 and remove path location from environment-variables and install new jdk1.8.166 v and set the path in java_home and path 

2)Error occurred during initialization of VM - Could not reserve enough space for 2097152KB object heap

If you want to release your app in the Google Play Store, you have to sign your APK file
> keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-testrelease-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias my-alias

To sign the unsigned APK, run the jarsigner tool which is also included in the JDK:
> jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore my-testrelease-key.jks <path - D:\Sudhakar\WorkSpaces - NodeJS\WorkSpace\myappsidemenu\platforms\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug>/app-testrelease-unsigned.apk my-alias

we need to run the zip align tool to optimize the APK
> C:\Users\thpbsm\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\24.0.0\zipalign -v 4 "D:\Sudhakar\WorkSpaces - NodeJS\WorkSpace\myappsidemenu\platforms\android\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk" myappsidemenu.apk

To verify that your apk is signed run apksigner.
> C:\Users\thpbsm\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\build-tools\24.0.0\apksigner verify HelloWorld.apk

for run ionic emulater 
> npm i -D -E -g @ionic/app-scripts

run on android emulater 
> adb install "D:\Sudhakar\WorkSpaces - NodeJS\WorkSpace\myappsidemenu\platforms\android\myappsidemenu.apk"
